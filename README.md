## Data Structure Repository

This project covers a variety of graph algorithms implemented by me.


## Features

- Simple class implementations of various data structures (Binary Trees, Graphs, Linked lists, Hash Tables, Unions)
- Many graph-related algorithms (BFS, DFS, Minimum spanning tree algorithms, Shortest Path - Dijkstra/Bellman Ford, Topological sort, informed search algorithms with ascii maps as input/output)
- A pygame interactive game which features 3 pathfinding algos: BFS, DFS and A*. (Currently having problems with dependencies)
